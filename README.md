# odinproject
This is where you will find all the projects I have completed from going through the odin project. More info about the odin project can be found at their website (https://www.theodinproject.com). These projects will demonstrate I have necessary skills in web development such as html, css and javascript knowledge (including react framework). The projects are split into the foundations section and then the full stack section. The foundations section will show more basic projects mainly for my benefit of progression whereas the full stack section will contain projects that will hopefully contain good quality code which you may be interested in having a glance at.
